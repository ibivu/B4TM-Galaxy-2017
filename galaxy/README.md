# Galaxy Cloud instances

A [Galaxy Instance 1](https://github.com/ibivu/B4TM-Galaxy-2017/tree/master/docker#galaxy-instance-1---on-port-8880) is running separately on two servers, each of which has 12 CPUs and 80 GB memeory. Each group will be allocated only one of the servers. Optionally, you may finish Part 1 of the assignment there, if Docker does not work normally in your computer; likewise, you may run Heinz for Part 2 there, if your computer cannot handle the computation.

**Due to the limited computation resources, each group should run only one  (Heinz) job  at any given time.**
